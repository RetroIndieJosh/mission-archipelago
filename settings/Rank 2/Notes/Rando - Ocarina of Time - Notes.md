(These are pretty much just a start, there are too many options! Didn't get to: randomizing songs, shuffling bosses, random spawns, owl drops, entrances. Probably better to think of area randomization as a separate game)

## 2025-05-14 + 2025-05-23 (Easy)
Time 1:52:44
- technically not completed, died twice at Ganon second phase
    - stupid hard with six hearts
- the rest was easiest of easy:
    - biggoron in river grotto
    - light arrows for 10 skulls
    - bow in lost woods (shrub)
    - magic at adult shooting gallery
    - only dungeon *entered* (let alone *completed*) was DC
- trouble with these "easy" settings is getting to end too quickly
    - not many hearts or useful items like bottles available
    - can wildly swing from super quick (this one) to probably much longer
