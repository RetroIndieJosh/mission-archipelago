- would be nice to have a mode where you end on bosses, since that final exit is always anticlimactic   
    - less likely to end on a boss level since they don't need keys, and often keys are the final lock
    - can do manually by grabbing all checks in boss levels, then finishing them last, but would be better built-in
- often basically hundo, saving hints for the last few missing items but grabbing everything for FOMO
- Medium is about the limit of my skill level, esp with frustrating death level resets
- shuffle enemies is a LOT easier than random_balanced
    - random_balanced often leads to stuck enemies and can put cacos and barons in E1
- shuffle pickups leaves E1 without any plasma ammo, which makes cacos and barons a pain
- TODO changes: 
    - easy/normal shuffle enemies, hard/brutal random_balanced, nightmare random_chaotic
    - random_balanced pickups for everything
