  final_zone_last:
    # Control when Final Zone can unlock, wait until all other victory conditions are met?
    # 
    # - **Anytime:** You can do Final Zone as soon as you have the key.
    # - **Last But Optional:** If your victory conditions can be achieved without beating Final Zone you skip it.
    # - **Always Last:** Final Zone unlocks once you have every other victory condition, beat it to win.
    # 
    # Note that this may change how certain mechanics behave:
    # 
    # - "Always Last" essentially forces the boss goal to be at least 1, "Last But Optional" will not.
    # - Both "Always Last" and "Last But Optional" will add the Final Zone key to your starting inventory.
    # - "Always Last" and "Last But Optional" are identical with 6 bosses.
    # - An example of less than 6: "Always Last" with 3 bosses will require any 2 of the Act 3 bosses then FZ, "Last But Optional" requires any 2 of the Act 3 bosses then either FZ or a third Act 3 boss.
