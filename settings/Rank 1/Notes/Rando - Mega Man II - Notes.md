## Notes
- doesn't really work as a solo rando; strange things can happen
    - for instance, enter flash twice since he's the first unlock and you need flash's item to get the first 1-up
    - basically need to be able to do buster only (similar to SMW small only)
- easy to forget you can go to Wily once you have all 3 items (may checks in Wily 1-4)
- everything is redelivered at start 
    - can you refill E-Tanks with a reset? it weirdly allows more than four >.>
    - this includes weapon/health energy so you get an extra boost
- don't seem to be any 1-up drops from enemies (at least not when stage 1-ups are checks)
- serious imbalance in number of checks per robo: some are just the boss, Quick has FIVE (for 1-up/E-Tank, plus SEVERAL TVs)
- not sure it's even plausible to play on J ("difficult") mode
- so many E-Tanks in the pool makes it easier, but by the time you find them you're probably better equipped!
