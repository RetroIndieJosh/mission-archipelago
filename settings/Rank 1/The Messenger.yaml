    # - entrance: Riviere Turquoise
    #   exit: Wingsuit
    # - entrance: Sunken Shrine
    #   exit: Sunny Day
    # - entrance: Searing Crags

    # connections will be coupled. If on decoupled, "entrance" and "exit" will be treated the same, simply making the
    # plando connection one-way from entrance to exit.

    # - entrance: Searing Crags - Top
    #   exit: Dark Cave - Right
