  progression_balancing:
    # A system that can move progression earlier, to try and prevent the player from getting stuck and bored early.
    # 
    # A lower setting means more getting stuck. A higher setting means less getting stuck.

    # You can define additional values between the minimum and maximum values.
    # Minimum value is 0
    # Maximum value is 99

  accessibility:
    # Set rules for reachability of your items/locations.

    # **Full:** ensure everything can be reached and acquired.
    # 
    # **Minimal:** ensure what is needed to reach your goal can be acquired.

  TriforceLocations:
    # Where Triforce fragments can be located. Note that Triforce pieces
    # obtained in a dungeon will heal and warp you out, while overworld Triforce pieces obtained will appear to have
    # no immediate effect. This is normal.

  StartingPosition:
    # How easy is the start of the game.
    # Safe means a weapon is guaranteed in Starting Sword Cave.
    # Unsafe means that a weapon is guaranteed between Starting Sword Cave, Letter Cave, and Armos Knight.
    # Dangerous adds these level locations to the unsafe pool (if they exist):
    #       Level 1 Compass, Level 2 Bomb Drop (Keese), Level 3 Key Drop (Zols Entrance), Level 3 Compass
    # Very Dangerous is the same as dangerous except it doesn't guarantee a weapon. It will only mean progression
    # will be there in single player seeds. In multi worlds, however, this means all bets are off and after checking
    # the dangerous spots, you could be stuck until someone sends you a weapon
