## Notes
- will definitely make you better at SMW: requires basically small Mario runs
- Normal generated a seed with:
    - first powerup in vanilla secret exit, so I'd need to know it (I think that's why it gave balloon early?)
    - other two in Star Road 2 and 5 secret exits, so would need Yoshi and Swim minimally
        - plus the knowledge of how to get to them directly since the path to SR1 requires cape
