    # 
    # **Minimal:** ensure what is needed to reach your goal can be acquired.
    # 
    # **Items:** ensure all logically relevant items can be acquired. Some items, such as keys, may be self-locking, and

  sm_logic:
    # This option selects what kind of logic to use for item placement inside
    # Super Metroid.
    # 
    # Normal - Normal logic includes only what Super Metroid teaches players
    # itself. Anything that's not demonstrated in-game or by the intro cutscenes
    # will not be required here.
    # 
    # Hard - Hard logic is based upon the "no major glitches" ruleset and
    # includes most tricks that are considered minor glitches, with some 
    # restrictions. You'll want to be somewhat of a Super Metroid veteran for
    # this logic.
    # 
    # See https://samus.link/information for required moves.

  goal:
    # This option decides what goal is required to finish the randomizer.
    # Defeat Ganon and Mother Brain - Find the required crystals and boss tokens to kill both bosses.

    #                                      Ganon's Tower and Ganon can be defeat as soon you have the required 
    #                                      crystals to make Ganon vulnerable. For keysanity, this mode also removes 
    #                                      the Crateria Boss Key requirement from Tourian to allow faster access.
    # All Dungeons and Defeat Mother Brain -  Similar to "Defeat Ganon and Mother Brain", but also requires all dungeons 
    #                                         to be beaten including Castle Tower and Agahnim.
