- guarantee that at least one seed of each available game is included
    - is this possible? or already the default?
- allow option to work like async tools (all games named in async.yaml, no others, included)
    - will require searching through rank dirs to find a match
- name seeds based on the game
    - can we put `name` *inside* the game yaml?
- auto-adjust weights based on rank
    - some kind of multiplier, e.g. 1/2 for each rank after 1
        - Rank 1, Weight 20 => Weight 20 
        - Rank 2, Weight 20 => Weight 10 
        - Rank 3, Weight 20 => Weight 5 
        - Rank 4, Weight 20 => Weight 2 
    - allow setting of multiplier either in async.yaml or CLI
