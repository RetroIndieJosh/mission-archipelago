- guarantee that at least one seed of each available game is included when AP generates
    - although this is either built-in or would require modding AP
- auto-adjust weights based on rank
    - some kind of multiplier, e.g. 1/2 for each rank after 1
        - Rank 1, Weight 20 => Weight 20 
        - Rank 2, Weight 20 => Weight 10 
        - Rank 3, Weight 20 => Weight 5 
        - Rank 4, Weight 20 => Weight 2 
    - allow setting of multiplier either in async.yaml or CLI
