description: RetroIndieJosh - Mission Archipelago Game Weights
requires:
  version: 0.6.4

# count - generate the exact number of games given
# weights - use values in game section as weights (total # of games specified on generation)
#
# FOR EXAMPLE:
#   Mega Man 2: 5        # weights: 5/20 = 25% of generated games / count: 5 games
#   DOOM 1993: 8         # weights: 8/20 = 40% of generated games / count: 8 games
#   Ocarina of Time: 4   # weights: 4/20 = 20% of generated games / count: 4 games
#   Subnautica: 3        # weights: 3/20 = 15% of generated games / count: 3 games
# count: always generates 20 games
# weights: can generate any number of games (if < 20, games may be skipped!)
generation: count

# all - generate all games listed (except with count/weight 0)
# rank - generate games based on folder structure up to max-rank
#   note that this will fail if it finds a game with no count/weight; use 0 to skip
categorize: all

# the maximum rank generated (only in categorize: rank)
# minimum: 1
# maximum: the highest Rank folder in /settings
max-rank: 4

# multiplier for weights based on rank (no effect in count mode)
# final = MAX(original^((max-rank - rank) * rank-mult))
# default: 1
rank-mult: 2

# multiplier for game count in count mode (no effect in rank mode)
# final = original * (world-mult + random(0, world-mult-range+1))
world-mult: 1
#world-mult-range: 3
