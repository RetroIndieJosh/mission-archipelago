# Mission Archipelago
Multiworld yaml generator for [Archipelago](www.archipelago.gg) asyncs run by
[Retro Indie Josh](retroindiejosh.itch.io). Props to [Async
Tools](https://github.com/ArchipelagoMW/AsyncTools) for giving me a starting
point.

## Usage
1. update `ap-async.bat` with paths to your AP install (PLAYERS and WORLDS)
1. Modify `async.yaml` with your desired settings and weights (options
documented in the included file)
1. Run `gen-async.bat` to generate the AP yaml files for the async
1. Run `ap-async.bat` to generate the worlds in your AP "output" directory

## Notes
When using weights, Archipelago guarantees every game gets at least one seed,
even if the weight is 0 or the requested player count is lower than the number
of possible players

## TODO - BUGS
- fails in weights mode because weights.yaml isn't set up correctly

## TODO - FEATURES
- separate async.yaml (settings) from game-weights.yaml (game weights - won't
need top level "game" key anymore)
- verify minimum versions in game yamls
- update ap-gen.bat to default to 1 multiworld if just press enter (blank)
- don't generate weights.yaml in count mode
- update ap-gen.bat to use weights if weights.yaml exists, count otherwise
- override switches in generate such as --mode weights, --mode count, --max-rank 3
- output final data table as csv (possible --csv option)
- fix categorize: rank, max rank, and rank mult (will require determining and retaining rank for each game, instead of flattening the directory structure and ignoring it)
- detect number of games generated from AP output when using weight mode and print a summary at the end
- setup script or on a first run of gen-async.bat asking for path to AP install so gen-async.bat doesn't require manual modification (and some mechanics to reset to change)
