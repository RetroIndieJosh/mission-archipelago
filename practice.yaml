requires:
  version: 0.6.4

# set total-games for weights mode; otherwise numbers are count of games
# count - generate the exact number of games given
# weights - use values in game section as weights (total # of games specified on generation)
#
# FOR EXAMPLE:
#   Mega Man 2: 5        # weights: 5/20 = 25% of generated games / count: 5 games
#   DOOM 1993: 8         # weights: 8/20 = 40% of generated games / count: 8 games
#   Ocarina of Time: 4   # weights: 4/20 = 20% of generated games / count: 4 games
#   Subnautica: 3        # weights: 3/20 = 15% of generated games / count: 3 games
# count: always generates 20 games
# weights: can generate any number of games (if < 20, games may be skipped!)
# NOTE: if this is set, world-mult and world-mult-range are IGNORED
#total-games: 20

# multiplier for game count in count mode (no effect in rank mode)
# final = original * (world-mult + random(0, world-mult-range+1))
# NOTE: this is ignored if total-games is set
world-mult: 1
#world-mult-range: 1

# 0 for random seed, [1, 4294967296] OR [0x1, 0x100 000 000] for deterministic
seed: 0

# path to FFR seeds - these must be generated manually
# the number of yaml/nes files in this directory must EXACTLY match the number
# of games generated, so if you're using total-games this only works if seed is
# set and you dry run to see how many you need
